The *.cpp codes do Monte Carlo simulations from binary systems including compact objects and main-sequence stars, and make their light curves.  

The python-based codes analyze the results from Monet Carlo simulations, and plot sample of light curves.  

The code modelSelf.py also generates self-lensign signals due to different configurations of these binary systems.
